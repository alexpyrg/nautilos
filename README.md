## About FlexBuildCMS
    
    This CMS has been created in order to satisfy customers that want to have access to their Webpages content, translations and SEO.
    From inside the administration panel they are granted access to almost everything possible. Edit page content, WYSIWYG editors for email templates, and anything else imaginable.
    Currently it's been customized to fit businesses like hotels and others. In the future it should be scaled to a full CMS.
