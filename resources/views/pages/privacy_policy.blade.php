    All reservations must be guaranteed with a deposit of 30% of the total booking. This deposit is payable at confirmation of booking. We require prepayment by bank transfer or credit card details in order to guarantee your reservation. If the customer does not provide the credit card details  within the agreed time, (02 hours after the positive availability reply ) the reservation is considered invalid and therefore rooms will be available to rent to other customers. Once the prepayment has been verified, we will send you the final booking confirmation (Voucher) and the receipt of your prepayment attached in (PDF),  to the e-mail address provided to us during the booking process. In order to safeguard and encrypt your credit card information when in transit to us, we use the "Secure Socket Layer (SSL)" technology for our services.
    The hotel has the right when receiving a reservation to pre-authorize up to the full reservation amount your credit card 14 days before your arrival.
    Non-valid credit cards will result in automatic cancellation of the reservation.

    <span style="display: block;font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; margin:0;">By bank transfer.</span>
    If you do not wish to confirm your reservation electronically, you can  guarantee your reservation by depositing the 50% from the final amount  in the Hotel's Bank Account by bank transfer. Upon making the booking payment, the client must take on the cost of the transfer, in the case that these were applicable. If the advance prepayment is not paid within the agreed time, (2 working days) the reservation is considered invalid and the rooms will be available to rent. Once made the bank transfer, you will need to send us the payment receipt by e-mail, and when the operation has been validated we will send you the final booking confirmation.
